NAME
    webchatpp - Preprocessor for Web Chat scripts

SYNOPSIS
     webchatpp chat-script | perl

DESCRIPTION
    The `webchatpp' program is a preprocessor that turns chat scripts into
    plain perl scripts. When this script is feed to perl it will perform the
    chatting. The *webchat language* consist of perl code with some lines
    interpreted and expanded by *webchatpp*. The following statements are
    recognized:

    GET <uri>
        This will fetch the indicated URI. The URI can be relative to the
        previous one. Each GET gets it's own eval block within the perl
        program to catch any exceptions. Inside this block, the following
        dynamically scoped variables are available:

          $uri       The current URI
          $req       The current request object        [HTTP::Request]
          $res       The response received             [HTTP::Response]
          $status    The status code of the response
          $ct        The content type of the response
          $_         The content of the response
          @forms     Forms found in current content    [HTML::Form]
          $form      Current form                      [HTML::Form]

    EXPECT <expr>
        Evaluate the perl expression <expr> and report failure if it does
        not return TRUE. The fact that content of the response is available
        in $_ makes it easy to match it with regular expressions. The
        routines OK() and ERROR() is available to test the response status
        code.

        When EXPECT fails all tests nested within this one is aborted too.

    FORM[:<no>] [<name>]
        Define which <FORM> should be the current one. Sets the `$form'
        variable. If no number is specified, then number 1 is assumed. If a
        form with the given number (or name, if specified) can not be found,
        then an exception is raised, and this block is aborted.

    F <name>=<value>
        Set input values within the current form. If the current form has no
        field named <name>, then an exception is raised. If the form has
        multiple fields named <name>, then only the first one is affected.

    CLICK [<name>] [<x> <y>]
        Submit a <form>. If there are multiple submit buttons, then you can
        specify which one by passing the <name>. You can also indicate which
        coordinates within the buttion, was clicked. Only makes a difference
        for `input/image' submits.

        CLICK enters a new block similar to GET, and make the same
        dynamically scoped variables available.

        You can use the keyword "SUBMIT" instead of "CLICK" if you prefer.
        It is a plain alias.

    BACK [<levels> | "ALL"]
        Ends the previous GET or CLICK blocks. The argument can be used to
        get out of multiple blocks.

    _END__
        Stop looking for *webchat language* directives. The rest of the
        script is dumped directly (and is also ignored by perl). Implies
        "`BACK ALL'".

    The following variables are global within the whole web chat script
    produced:

      $ua        User agent object    [LWP::UserAgent]
      $uri       Current URI
      $TRACE     Print trace showing HTTP requests/responses.

ENVIRONMENT
    The initial value of the $TRACE variable is initialized from the
    WEBCHAT_TRACE environment variable.

    Proxy settings are picked up from the environment too. See the
    "env_proxy" entry in the LWP::UserAgent manpage.

EXAMPLES
    This is a sample script:

     GET http://www.perl.com
        EXPECT OK && /perl/
        GET not_there.html
           EXPECT ERROR
        BACK
     BACK

    And here is another one

     GET http://www.altavista.com
     EXPECT OK
     F q=Gisle
     CLICK
     EXPECT OK && /Gisle Aas/
